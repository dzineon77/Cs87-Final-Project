# CS87 Course Project Repository

This repository contains the code and documentation for the CS87 course project. This project aims to investigate performance improvements on a benchmark computationally-intensive Conway's Game of Life (GOL) using CUDA GPU parallelization and MPI distributed computing. We also briefly investigate a hybrid approach aiming to leverage the increase in computational efficiency possible by using both approaches. See our final report in the FinalReport directory for our literature review, methods, results, and conclusions.  

## Getting Started

To get started with this project, follow the instructions below.

### Prerequisites

- GPU for CUDA acceleration
