This is the top-level directory for our project source code

For running CUDA:
##################################

Navigate to Rectangle subdirectory, and run make. golDEMOcopy.cu is not linked to the Makefile and will not 
be impacted. To run from terminal, run: 
./gol -n (board width) -m (board height) -i (iterations) -o (oscillator flag)

To recreate results as seen in the outputs folder, uncomment each test experiment individually and run 
bash script ./runCUDA.sh. To experiment with optimizer flag, comment/uncomment the CFLAGS -O2 ... 
line and re-run make.

For running MPI:
##################################

Simply run make. To run from terminal, use ssh-agent bash and ssh-add to enable MPI mpirun. Then, run: 
mpirun -n (# hosts) -hostfile (hostfile) ./golMPI -n (nxn board dimensions) -i (iterations) -o (oscillator flag)

To recreate results as seen in the outputs folder, uncomment each test experiment individually 
and run bash script ./golMPI-test.sh. 

For running MPI-CUDA:
##################################

Simply run make. To run from terminal, follow same process as MPI via ssh-add and run:
mpirun -n (# hosts) -hostfile (hostfile) ./golMPI-CUDA -n (board width) -m (board height) -i (iterations) -o (oscillator flag)

Run bash script ./golMPI-CUDA-test.sh to recreate results
